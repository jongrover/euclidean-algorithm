# Euclidean Algorithm

In mathematics, the Euclidean algorithm [a], or Euclid's algorithm, is an efficient method for computing the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers, the largest number that divides both of them without leaving a remainder.

This app takes two numbers for the larger rectangle and will tell you how many tiles of the largest size will fit within the space.

This is my first attempt at solving this using procedural JavaScript. It is working nicely, but there is room to be refactored further or changed to OO.
